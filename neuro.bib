  abstract = {The brain's sensitivity to unexpected gains or losses plays an important role in our ability to learn new behaviors (Rescorla and Wagner, 1972; Sutton and Barto, 1990). Recent work suggests that gains and losses are ubiquitously encoded throughout the human brain (Vickery et al., 2011), however, the extent to which reward expectation modulates these valence representations is not known. To address this question, we analyzed recordings from 4306 intracranially implanted electrodes in 39 neurosurgical patients as they performed a two-alternative probability learning task. Using high-frequency activity (HFA, 70\textendash{}200Hz) as an indicator of local firing rates, we found that expectation modulated reward-related neural activity in widespread brain regions, including regions that receive sparse inputs from midbrain dopaminergic neurons. The strength of unexpected gain signals predicted subjects' abilities to encode stimulus\textendash{}reward associations. Thus, neural signals that are functionally related to learning are widely distributed throughout the human brain.},

  abstract = {Summary
People often forget information because they fail to effectively encode it. Here, we test the hypothesis that targeted electrical stimulation can modulate neural encoding states and subsequent memory outcomes. Using recordings from neurosurgical epilepsy patients with intracranially implanted electrodes, we trained multivariate classifiers to discriminate spectral activity during learning that predicted remembering from forgetting, then decoded neural activity in later sessions in which we applied stimulation during learning. Stimulation increased encoding-state estimates and recall if delivered when the classifier indicated low encoding efficiency but had the reverse effect if stimulation was delivered when the classifier indicated high encoding efficiency. Higher encoding-state estimates from stimulation were associated with greater evidence of neural activity linked to contextual memory encoding. In identifying the conditions under which stimulation modulates memory, the data suggest strategies for therapeutically treating memory dysfunction.},

  abstract = {4 Neuronal firing in the substantia nigra (SN) immediately following reward is thought to play 5 a crucial role in human reinforcement learning. As in Ramayya et al., (2014) we applied 6 microstimulation in the SN of patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment 7 of Parkinson's disease as they engaged in a two-alternative reinforcement learning task. We 8 obtained microelectrode recordings to assess the proximity of the electrode tip to putative 9 dopaminergic and GABAergic SN neurons and applied stimulation to assess the functional 10 importance of these neuronal populations for learning. We found that the proximity of SN 11 microstimulation to putative GABAergic neurons predicted the degree of stimulation-related 12 changes in learning. These results extend previous work by supporting a specific role for SN 13 GABA firing in reinforcement learning. Stimulation near these neurons appears to dampen the 14 reinforcing effect of rewarding stimuli.},
